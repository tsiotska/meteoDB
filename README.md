About workflow:
 - This project was created for development purposes<br>
 At first it was a simple JS (jQuery) handled page<br>
 Next step is to move it to Asp.Net React, but must we?<br>
Currently it's a single page app and API is very weak (especially json models) <br>
In my opinion, we just need to add some prod style and featured components

So, we must rewrite this project nearly at half
